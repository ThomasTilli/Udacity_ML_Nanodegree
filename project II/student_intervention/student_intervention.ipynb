The best results we get for SVM. The runtime consumption for naive Bayes is very low, but it gives the worsest prediction.  Kneighbors is quite fast for our problem and it gives good results, but SVM gives the best results. SVM has the highest runtime , but our problem size is small and the runtime to predict the results for 100 students is about 1 ms.  This is fast enough for our purposes.\n",

A good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class (so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin the lower the generalization error of the classifier. The goal is therefore to maximzis this margin. The following figure shows different planes H1, h2 and H3 to separate the white and the black points. H1 does not separate this both classes, H2 does but with a low margin, h3 seperates them with the maximum margin.\n",
