# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

These are my projects for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. Two further will follow next time: reinforcement learning project
and final capstone project.

- Project 1: Supervised learning (regression): precicting house prices.
- Project 2: Supervised learning (classification): building a student intervention system.
- Project 3: Unsupervised learning (k-means clustering, PCA and ICA): customer segmentation
- Project 4: Reinforcement Learning: Train a Smartcab How to Drive
- Capstone Project: Recognizing Street View House Numbers

Software requirements:
- Project 1 to 3: Anaconda python 2.7
- Project 4: Anaconda python 2.7 and pygame library (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
- Capstone Project: Anaconda python 2.7, Python Pillow, Tensorflow r.012
